<h2 align="center">The Greatest Finals in NBA History</h2>

<p><font size="8">The 2016 NBA Finals is widely considered one of the greatest series in basketball history.
   For me locked up the greatest player arguments for me. 
   This Golden State team was the Best (Team) assembled without having over powered superstars like Kevin Durant. 
   The pre KD warriors still won 73 games and as a team didn't have too many flaws.
    even pushed Lebron 3-1 in the finals where historical if you go down 3-1 in the finals you never win. 
    So Lebron being the first player to do it against one of the greatest team in history is special for me.</font></p>
