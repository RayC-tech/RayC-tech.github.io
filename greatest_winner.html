<h2 align="center">The Greatest Winner in NBA History</h2>

<p><font size="8">Michael Jordan is widely celebrated as the greatest basketball player of all time.
   I will not discredit his awards, rings or play on the court. 
   As his nearly perfect resume leads new players aspiring to be the greatest of all time to have great career from the rookie year especially in the NBA Finals. 
  Not losing in the finals with at least a 6-0 record is a requirement now apparently.</font> </p>
