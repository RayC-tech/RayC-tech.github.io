<h2 align="center">Curry Beats Boston</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/maxresdefault (3).jpg" alt="Curry Beats Boston" width="800" height="500"></div>
<p>The 2022 NBA Finals was a defining chapter in Steph Curry's legendary career. 
  Facing off against the Boston Celtics, Curry delivered a masterclass in leadership,
   skill, and determination, earning his first Finals MVP award. For me, 
   This defined Curry as a clutch performer and his leadership in the playoffs. 
   As he was constantly criticized for having great teams below average performances in previous playoffs 
   and final appearance this playoff locked Curry as top 10 payer in history.</p>

<h2 align="center">The Greatest Shooter in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/nba-1.jpg" alt="Curry Greatest Shooter" width="800" height="500"> </div>
<p>Steph Curry has completely transformed the game of basketball is undeniably a top 10 player.
   Starting as a injure prone player all the way to a 2 time MVP who won 4 rings.
    Also is consider the “Greatest Shooter known to man” safe to say if Curry shots it, it's probable going in.
     Besides that if you ask me he's also the greatest point guard ever and even redefining how point guards play basketball today
      as the lead guard now has to be able to hit a 3 to stay in the lead now.</p>

<h2 align="center">The Greatest Shot in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/mj-game-6.png" alt="Jordan 1997 Finals" width="500" height="500"></div>
<p>The 1997 NBA Finals was a classic battle. Led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the Bulls faced a tough challenge from Karl Malone and John Stockton. 
  One of the most iconic Game 5, known as the “Flu Game,” where Michael Jordan, 
  visibly ill and physically drained, delivered a heroic 38-point performance to lead his team to victory. 
  Where in my opinion this was the greatest shot in history.</p>

  <h2 align="center">The Greatest Winner in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/wire-gettyimages-51655944.webp" alt="Jordan Winner" width="800" height="500"></div>
<p>Michael Jordan is widely celebrated as the greatest basketball player of all time.
   I will not discredit his awards, rings or play on the court. 
   As his nearly perfect resume leads new players aspiring to be the greatest of all time to have great career from the rookie year especially in the NBA Finals. 
  Not losing in the finals with at least a 6-0 record is a requirement now apparently.</p>

<h2 align="center">The Greatest Finals in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/lbj_160619_0.webp" alt="2016 Finals" width="800" height="500"></div>
<p>The 2016 NBA Finals is widely considered one of the greatest series in basketball history.
   For me locked up the greatest player arguments for me. 
   This Golden State team was the Best (Team) assembled without having over powered superstars like Kevin Durant. 
   The pre KD warriors still won 73 games and as a team didn't have too many flaws.
    even pushed Lebron 3-1 in the finals where historical if you go down 3-1 in the finals you never win. 
    So Lebron being the first player to do it against one of the greatest team in history is special for me.</p>

    
<h2 align="center">The Greatest Player in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/180701213413-lebron-james-game-7-052718.jpg" alt="LeBron James" width="800" height="500"></div>
<p>LeBron James is one of the most influential and dominant players in NBA history. 
  For me he the Greatest one I grew up watching him so bias is a thing. 
  Two the longevity is undeniable with him to any one to catch what Lebron did you have to never really get a long term injure,
   can't leave the game of basketball for a extended period of time. 
  Then by your 2nd year you have to average 27 pts 7 asts and 7 rebs for 20 years which is just as impossible as Micheal Jordan's winning record in the finals.</p>
