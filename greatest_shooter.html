<h2 align="center">The Greatest Shooter in NBA History</h2>

<p><font size="8">Steph Curry has completely transformed the game of basketball is undeniably a top 10 player.
   Starting as a injure prone player all the way to a 2 time MVP who won 4 rings.
    Also is consider the “Greatest Shooter known to man” safe to say if Curry shots it, it's probable going in.
     Besides that if you ask me he's also the greatest point guard ever and even redefining how point guards play basketball today
      as the lead guard now has to be able to hit a 3 to stay in the lead now.</font></p>
