<h2 align="center">The Greatest Shot in NBA History</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="images/mj-game-6.png" alt="Jordan 1997 Finals" width="500" height="500"></div>
<p><font size="8">The 1997 NBA Finals was a classic battle. Led by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the Bulls faced a tough challenge from Karl Malone and John Stockton. 
  One of the most iconic Game 5, known as the “Flu Game,” where Michael Jordan, 
  visibly ill and physically drained, delivered a heroic 38-point performance to lead his team to victory. 
  Where in my opinion this was the greatest shot in history.</font></p>
