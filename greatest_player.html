<p><font size="8">LeBron James is one of the most influential and dominant players in NBA history. 
  For me he the Greatest one I grew up watching him so bias is a thing. 
  Two the longevity is undeniable with him to any one to catch what Lebron did you have to never really get a long term injure,
   can't leave the game of basketball for a extended period of time. 
  Then by your 2nd year you have to average 27 pts 7 asts and 7 rebs for 20 years which is just as impossible as Micheal Jordan's winning record in the finals.</font> </p>
