<p> <font size="8">The 2022 NBA Finals was a defining chapter in Steph Curry's legendary career. 
  Facing off against the Boston Celtics, Curry delivered a masterclass in leadership,
   skill, and determination, earning his first Finals MVP award. For me, 
   This defined Curry as a clutch performer and his leadership in the playoffs. 
   As he was constantly criticized for having great teams below average performances in previous playoffs 
   and final appearance this playoff locked Curry as top 10 payer in history.</font></p>
